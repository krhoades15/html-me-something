    <h2>Boi 1 - Jasper Wallace</h2><br>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jwcsfqY.jpg?2" alt="Jasper Wallace">
    <p>This fine thicc specimen is Jasper Wallace. His birthday is 
    January 2, 2015. My husband Justin and I adopted him from an 
    animal hospital my friend worked at at the time. He was only 
    5 months old, and the sweetest most snuggly cat I ever met. I fell
    in love immediately. I was never really a cat person until I took 
    this guy home. Life was never the same, and it continues to get
    better every day.</p>

    <p>Here we have the last but not least boi, Ace Neo. his birthday is 
    February 5, 2017. Ace was adopted on kind of a whim. Justin and I have 
    always talked about getting a dog, but our work schedules were wonky and 
    dogs are a lot of responsibility. However, we made the plunge one day and
    adopted this little prince and our family became complete.
